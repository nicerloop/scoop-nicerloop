# scoop-nicerloop

my own personal [scoop bucket](https://scoop.sh/) of applications.

Install scoop like this:
```powershell
iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
```

Then install this software bucket like this:
```powershell
scoop bucket add nicerloop https://github.com/nicerloop/scoop-nicerloop
```

Now you can quickly and automatically install the software registered here.
```powershell
scoop install <software>
```

That's it!
