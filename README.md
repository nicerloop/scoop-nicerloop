# scoop-nicerloop

my own personal [scoop bucket](https://scoop.sh/) of applications.

Install scoop like this:
```powershell
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
```

Then install this software bucket like this:
```powershell
scoop bucket add scoop-nicerloop https://github.com/nicerloop/scoop-nicerloop
```

Now you can quickly and automatically install the software registered here.
```powershell
scoop install <software>
```

That's it!
